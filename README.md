## Description üìÉ
Cookies is a project we did as our capstone project in coding bootcamp, we were responsible for the backend, and the other team was responsible for the frontend.

the website was about homemade food that can be served to customers, we were four in a team and we had SCRUM meetings and everyone had to work with his partner on different tasking.

we implement many things including REST API, middlewares, authentication, integrating with the DB, and more.

## Developing Details üßë‚Äçüíª

the website was built with NodeJs& ExpressJs and for the DB we used mongodb along with its library mongoose as ODM.

while developing the endpoints we used Postman for testing which was a great tool to test your endpoints, and many packages made our developing process better like nodemailer to send emails when verifying the email, swagger for API documentation, passport for authentication, and bcrypt for cookies encryption
